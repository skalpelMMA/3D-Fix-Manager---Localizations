        This option controls whether to modify the driver profile of the game.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        If you have installed 3dmigoto this option is automatically disabled because 3dmigoto will take care of setting the driver profile for Compatibility Mode.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        When 3dmigoto is not installed CMU is used instead for adjusting the driver profile.

        Controls whether to enable CMU automatically when starting a game. The activation of CMU is done after a defined period you can adjust in the option below.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        CMU then patches the Nvidia driver and allows the CMU hotkeys to work in order increase the 3D depth beyond allowed values by pressing F11 (default key binding).<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>       
        If you leave this option disabled you have to press CTRL + SHIFT + T ingame for enabling CMU manually.

       Enter the convergence value you want to set when the hotkey is pressed.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
       Valid values range from 0.2 and 1.0. All numbers higher or lower than this are clamped by the Nvidia driver.
    </TextBlock>

    <TextBlock x:Key="CmuSeparationToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="300">
        Enter a factor to be multiplied with the current 3D depth.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        In other words with this factor you can exceed the very limited 3D depth of Compatibility Mode to improve the 3D effect.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        Example: if you choose a value of 2.2 this means that your maximum 3D depth is increased by 220%.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        You can also use the factor to lower the 3D depth (e.g. with a value of 0.2).<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        This is especially useful in ego shooters where you want to aim by holding the right mouse button. A low 3D depth in this situation makes aiming more comfortable.

    <system:String x:Key="DchWarningDchExplanationTitle">What does the term "DCH" stand for?</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="DchWarningDchExplanation">DCH is a new package format for drivers introduced with Windows 10. Microsoft's long-term plan is to make this the default driver type for Windows 10 and replace installed standard drivers with DCH ones. DCH and standard drivers are basically the same drivers - only how they are packed and installed differs.</system:String>

    <system:String x:Key="DchWarningDchWhyUnrecommendedTitle">Why are DCH drivers not recommended for Stereoscopic 3D?</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="DchWarningDchWhyUnrecommended">For current DCH drivers Stereo 3D compatibility is restored by applying workarounds what comes at the cost of an significantly increased loading time of apps and games in 3D mode. So for the moment we do not recommend to use current DCH drivers. Instead standard drivers are the preferred ones.</system:String>

    <system:String x:Key="DchWarningDchWhereToGetDefaultTitle">Where to get "Standard" Geforce drivers?</system:String>

    <system:String x:Key="DchWarningDchHowToReplaceTitle">How to replace DCH drivers with Standard ones?</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="DchWarningDchHowToReplace">Unfortunately it's not possible to replace the DCH driver by installing a standard driver over a DCH. Instead the DCH driver has to be completely removed from the system by using a third party tool called "Display Driver Uninstaller (shortly: DDU)". Please be aware that using DDU might damage your system. Before getting started it's recommended to unplug your internet cable to prevent Windows Update from automatically downloading and installing the DCH version of the driver again. Then reboot in "safe mode" of Windows and uninstall the Nvidia driver with DDU. Finally reboot again and install the standard driver.</system:String>

You can do this automatically by just clicking on the button "Install Geforce Driver 425.31 (DCH)".

        Nvidia officially dropped support for 3D Vision / stereoscopic 3D in May 2019 which means that the stereo 3D driver is no longer included in recent Geforce graphics drivers.
        Although not included in the driver package 3D Vision still can be installed and still is fully functional.
        3D Fix Manager does this part for you and restores 3D Vision / stereoscopic 3D functionality.

    <system:String x:Key="DriverUpdateImportantInfoExplanationVr">
        HelixVision requires the Nvidia 3D Vision driver which is only included in Geforce driver package up to version 425.31.
        We strongly recommend using version 425.31 for best results, but it is not required. Newer versions are working, but have not been fully tested.        
        When using newer drivers with HelixVision, you might run into incompatibilities and games that don't work.

        Unfortunately with Windows 10 version 1903 it is currently not possible to fully restore functionality of the 3D Vision driver with newer drivers.
        For users of 1903, we recommend using Geforce driver version 425.31 which is fully supported. Or using older versions of Windows 10. This incompatibility is under investigation.

    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L1">Dear 3D Vision fans,</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L2">we have sad news for you. On March 08, 2019 Nvidia officially announced the end of support for 3D Vision.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L3">This means that all graphics drivers released after March 2019 don't support 3D Vision any more.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L4">Driver branch 418 will be the last one to support stereoscopic 3D.</system:String>

    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L5">What does the announcement mean for us 3D gamers?</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L6">We are forced to stick with Geforce drivers of branch 418 or older (v.419.35 still works as it still belongs to branch 418)</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L7">We should not update Windows 10 beyond v.1809 (October Update 2018). New feature updates for Win 10 might break the stereo 3D driver.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L8">We have to take good care of our 3D Vision hardware as in the future it will be hard to get a replacement for defective devices</system:String>

    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L9">What does this mean for 3D Fix Manager?</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L10">Nothing. Support for 3D Fix Manager will be continued</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L11">3D Fix Manager warns you if you've already installed a Geforce driver beyond driver branch 418</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L12">In this case 3D Fix Manager provides download links to the last known driver version which was still compatible to 3D Vision</system:String>

    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L13">What does this mean for the development of new 3D fixes?</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L14">It's very likely that the development of new 3D fixes is continued as long as Shaderhackers have their 3D Vision hardware still working</system:String>

    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L15">What does this mean for the future of stereo 3D?</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L16">Currently our great community developers are discussing about developing an indepentent 3D solution not requiring the 3D Vision driver any more</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L17">Chances are not bad as there are already a lot of features implemented into 3dmigoto which are required to achieve this goal</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L18">But: At the time of writing no promises can be made!</system:String>

    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L19">Official announcement from Nvidia:</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_L20">For additional info we have opened a topic in Geforce forum:</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Announcement_DoNotShow">Do not show this dialog again</system:String>

    <system:String x:Key="Drivercheck_2">On March 08, 2019 Nvidia officially announced the end of support for 3D Vision.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Drivercheck_3">To make 3D Vision work you have to install an older graphics driver.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Drivercheck_4">Below you find download links for the last Geforce driver which was known to work with 3D Vision:</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Drivercheck_5">Please keep in mind that this driver might not work properly with future versions of Windows 10.  
                                         The driver was released at the time of Windows 10 v.1809 (October update 2018) so it's not recommended to use a more recent Windows version.

    <TextBlock x:Key="ForceCMToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="300">
        Forces DirectX 11 games to start in Compatibility Mode (also known as Fake 3D) by automatically modifying the driver profile.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        When Compatibility Mode does not look right then go to <Italic><Bold>"Hotkey"</Bold></Italic> tab and choose another value for 
        <Italic><Bold>2DDHUDSettings"</Bold></Italic> in section <Italic><Bold>"Driver Profile Settings</Bold></Italic>.
    </TextBlock>

    <TextBlock x:Key="EnableCmuToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="300">
       Enables <Bold>Compatibility Mode Unleashed</Bold> (shortly CMU).<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>    
       CMU is only available in DirectX 11 games and makes those games playable in stereo 3D even if they aren't fixed for 3D yet.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
       Another advantage of CMU is that it requires less performance for having a smooth gaming experience in 3D.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
       However compared to traditional 3D this mode suffers from 3D artefacts like halos around objects and 3D depth is more limited by default.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
       <Bold>Important information:</Bold> Press <Bold>F11</Bold> or <Bold>F12</Bold> (default configuration) ingame to "unleash" CMU for exceeding maximum 3D depth and improving the 3D effect.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
       Additionally in tab <Bold>"3D Fix"</Bold> you have options to configure CMU.
    </TextBlock>
    
    <TextBlock x:Key="EnableFixToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="300">
        Enables / disables the 3D fix manually.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        <Bold>Note:</Bold> Enabling / disabling 3D fixes is also automatically done when clicking on <Italic><Bold>"Play 2D"</Bold></Italic> or <Italic><Bold>"Play 3D"</Bold></Italic> buttons.
    </TextBlock>

    <TextBlock x:Key="InstallFixTooltip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="300">
        <Bold>Left click:</Bold> Installs / uninstalls the 3D fix.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        <Bold>Right click:</Bold> Resets 3dmigoto to the original version of the 3D fix if it was updated. Use this if updating 3dmigoto broke the fix.
    </TextBlock>

    <!-- New / Edit Profile Tab ToolTips -->
    <TextBlock x:Key="GameTitleToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="300">
        <Bold>Game title</Bold> has to be the same as listed in steam library or under installed programs in <Italic>"windows control panel / programs and features"</Italic><LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        Check the list on the right side to see all installed programs 3D Fix Manager has detected from Windows registry. Select a program for applying its name as a game title.
    </TextBlock>

    <TextBlock x:Key="RelativeInstallPathToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="300">
        Relative path to the subfolder of the game directory where the 3D Vision fix will be copied to.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        In most cases the correct install path is where the game exe is located for starting the game.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        <Bold>For example: </Bold> when the absolute path of the game exe is <Italic>"c:\gameTitle\bin\game.exe"</Italic> then the resulting relative install path is <Italic>"bin"</Italic><LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        Leave this field empty if the fix shall be installed to the root folder of the game.
    </TextBlock>

    <TextBlock x:Key="GameDirNameToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="300">
        Fill in the name of the Install - / root Folder of the game (only the folder name not the path).<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        This information is important for detecting the game via search paths.
    </TextBlock>

    <TextBlock x:Key="CustomRootPathToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="300">
        Only fill in this field if an installed game is not automatically detected by 3D Fix Manager.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        Choose the absolute path to the root folder of the game.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        Note: the 'Relative Install Path' must be still set if you want to install the fix in a subfolder of the game.
    </TextBlock>

    <TextBlock x:Key="RelativeGameIniPathToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="500">
        Type in the relative path to a <Bold>configuration file</Bold> of the game (e.g. an .ini or .cfg file) which shall be automatically edited based on the defined values for 2D or 3D mode. The relative path must be set starting from the <Bold>root path of the game</Bold> or <Bold>user folder</Bold> in <Italic>C:\Users\USERNAME</Italic> - both directories are searched for the specified configuration file.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        Main purpose of this feature is to automatically edit graphics settings when starting the game (e.g. deactivation of <Bold>motion blur</Bold> or <Bold>depth of field</Bold> which is unwanted for stereo 3d mode).<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        Generally all config files can be edited which include a listing of key/value - pairs - this might look like this in a file: <Italic><Bold>MotionBlur = Off</Bold></Italic>.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        Have a look at the fix profile for game <Italic><Bold>"Outlast"</Bold></Italic> to see a sample about how to edit a configuration file.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        Click on <Italic><Bold>"Values for 2D"</Bold></Italic> button for defining key-value pairs for the configuration file. These will be set when starting the game in 2D mode or uninstalling the fix.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        The same applies when clicking on <Italic><Bold>"Values for 3D"</Bold></Italic> button. The keys defined there will be set when starting the game in 3D mode or when installing the fix.
    </TextBlock>

    <TextBlock x:Key="HelixPostUpdatedToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="300">
       Saves the date when the helix post was last updated.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
       The timestamp is necessary for detecting if there is an updated helix post available online.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
       You should not set this date manually as this is done automatically.
    </TextBlock>

    <TextBlock x:Key="InfoAlternativeUrlToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="300">
        When there is an alternative 3D fix available for the game you can provide additional information about this fix.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
       <Bold>Custom Info Text:</Bold> Shows an info text when installing the 3D fix which informs the user about the existence of an alternative 3D fix. The individual text can be entered in the text field.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
       <Bold>SLI Info Text:</Bold> Shows a predefined info text when installing the 3D fix which informs the user about the existence of an alternative 3D fix which is optimized for SLI systems.

    </TextBlock>

    <TextBlock x:Key="Allow3dFixInstallationToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="300">
        Set this to <Italic><Bold>"No"</Bold></Italic> to warn the user from installing the 3D fix or 3D wrapper.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        By doing so the user is informed that the installation of the fix isn't required any more but can still be done if desired.
    </TextBlock>

    <TextBlock x:Key="Allow3dMigotoUpdateToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="300">
        Set this option to <Italic><Bold>"No"</Bold></Italic> if a new 3dmigoto version isn't compatible to an existing 3D fix. By doing so the user will be warned before updating the wrapper.
    </TextBlock>

    <TextBlock x:Key="StereoRefreshRateOverrideToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="300">
        Set this option 100 Hz if your PC is not strong enough to hold steady 120 frames per second while playing in Stereo 3D. <LineBreak /><LineBreak />
        When setting this to 100 Hz only 100 fps are required for smooth gameplay.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />
        This option only takes effect if you enabled <Italic><Bold>Refresh rate is controlled by fix profile</Bold></Italic> in <Italic><Bold>General Settings</Bold></Italic> tab.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />
        <Bold>Note:</Bold> When reducing refresh rate your Nvidia 3D glasses also work at a reduced shutter frequency. 100 Hz could be perceived as a flickering for some people.
    </TextBlock>

        <Bold>Note:</Bold> Installing a raw wrapper is especially interesting if a game is already 3D Vision Ready and does not need a 3D fix at all. By using the wrapper you can unlock features like hotkeys support for quickly changing separation / convergence in cut scences or for choosing other 3D formats like Side-By-Side for TVs and projectors.
    </TextBlock>

    <TextBlock x:Key="ProductPageUrlToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="300">

    <TextBlock x:Key="DepthMultiplierToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="300">
        Enable this option if you want to exceed the maximum possible value for the 3D depth (this procedure is also known as depth hack). This feature is especially useful for projectors as the maximum 3D depth is often too low for them.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        Depth hack is active as soon as you set the multiplier to a value higher than 1. For example if you set it to 2 you can achieve a 3D depth which is twice as high.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        With regard to this example this effectively means if you set 3D depth to 100% while gaming this will actually correspond a depth of 200% because multiplier was set to 2. Similarily 80% 3D depth will correspond 160% and so on.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        When using the depth hack you make the Nvidia driver think that you play with a smaller display size as it is actually. You can see the display size which was detected by the driver below. The smaller the inch value the greater the maximum 3D depth.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        3D depth hack is applied to all display profiles so you can increase the maximum 3D depth for all display devices equally.

        <Bold>Recommended:</Bold> For 3D Vision certified monitors or Generic CRT display devices you should set framerate to <Bold>"1/2 Stereo Refresh Rate"</Bold>. By doing so the framerate limit cam be detected automatically in dependency of the refresh rate of the display. Typically a fps limit of 60 fps results.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>

    <TextBlock x:Key="ScanlineSyncToolTip" TextWrapping="Wrap" Width="600">
        Scanline Sync is a new feature of RivaTuner Statistics Server which does have a similar effect like Vertical Sync on. As well as Vertical Sync, Scanline Sync prevents tearing and makes sure you get a steady clear image. You should use this feature when your display does not support G-Sync or Freesync.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        Advantage over Vertical Sync on is the ultra low input lag. Disadvantage however is that Scanline Sync does not work with all games and all refresh rates properly so far.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        Scanline Sync works by limiting the framerate to the refresh rate of your display with a tearline located in a fixed position. This tearline can be moved down via the scanline index until the line is hidden in vertical blanking interval.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/> 
        <Bold>Note:</Bold> So far it's known that Scanline Sync works best in 2D mode for resolution with 60 hz refresh rate. When using higher refresh rates intermittent tearing can occur or the tearline can be out of control. This depends on the individual game or the game engine it uses.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/> 
        <Bold>Important:</Bold> Vertical Sync has to be switched off ingame in order to make Scanline Sync work. Additionally Vertical Sync has to be disabled in the global driver profile as well. Turning off Vertical Sync in global driver profile is done automatically by 3D Fix Manager.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        <Bold>Recommended:</Bold> For 3D mode the best thing is to enable Scanline Sync in the individual fix profile only. By doing so you only use this feature when it actually works for the game. Additionally Scanline Sync should be turned off in the global driver profile then.<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
        For 2D mode and non-G-Sync / -Freesync devices you can try to enable Scanline-Sync on a global basis as the chances are higher that Scanline Sync works for that mode. For games where it does not work disable Scanline Sync in the individual fix profile then.
